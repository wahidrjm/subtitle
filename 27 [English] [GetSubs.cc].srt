1
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,100
This world is so desolate

2
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,200
Disaster

3
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,366
The heart threatens to turn into dust

4
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,966
Escape from this prison with sores and white holes

5
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,200
Swallow the pain

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,866
In the depression of endless fear

7
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,833
I have long heard that the devil flower king is cunning

8
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,866
I'll never be trapped by you before I meet you in front of others

9
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,200
It's just a matter of taking advantage of the situation

10
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,966
God does it and stops it

11
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:03,566
I didn’t expect it because you were just calculating.

12
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,866
The sanitation guard who became my devil came here

13
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:07,566
You still have to die

14
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,400
Your flower spots are all dead

15
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Don't think you can succeed like this

16
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,766
Haoyue can actually use sealing attribute magic

17
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,166
bring toxins together

18
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,800
And he also absorbed all these toxins

19
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,266
You said you were going to evolve again

20
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,533
What does that have to do with?

21
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,566
Go point me at a distance

22
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,866
It's doomed now

23
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,233
Everyone enters the Tower of Eternity

24
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,500
Even if you meet the king, you can still chase him here

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,900
Don't even think about posting any

26
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:32,033
Insolent mere beast

27
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,733
Follow the smell of the explosion to find it

28
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,666
I thought there would be a demon hunting group

29
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,900
Judging from these remaining traces

30
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,333
They went to the province of Jacques

31
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,966
Looks like our new prey is on the line

32
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,133
Don't die

33
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,200
Back off quickly

34
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,066
Europe Europe

35
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,866
I gave you the chance but you still didn’t take it.

36
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
The camp is so big

37
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,133
How about hunting down 100 dancing swords without being surprised?

38
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,066
The Yaks can only act separately

39
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,033
Everyone, please be careful

40
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:32,900
Quick win

41
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,200
In case of any accident

42
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,833
Use soul chains to deliver messages in time

43
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,400
We will meet again after completing the mission

44
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:47,766
ah

45
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,033
Ahhh

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,466
Not everyone can take my elixir.

47
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Strange why it's so cold all of a sudden

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,100
you are so nervous

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
what happened

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,433
This is their barracks

51
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,433
Gotta deal with them quickly

52
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,833
Added storm strike

53
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,000
It seems that everyone is going well

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,466
The mission is almost completed, huh?

55
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,000
ah

56
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,500
What's the big commotion?

57
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,733
Didn't Sauron only exist in ancient times?

58
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,600
Why did you get so obsessed with such a thing?

59
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,500
He was not taught by me

60
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,500
Haochen’s situation has changed

61
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,233
First go to the agreed place to meet everyone.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,566
head of the group head of the group

63
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:45,100
Why does the fire dragon appear here?

64
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,066
He seems to be at the end of his life

65
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,533
It's like being hunted here

66
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,366
That's just right

67
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,866
The leader said that his body was indestructible

68
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,033
Use him to refine elixirs

69
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,800
After taking it, you can gain defense power comparable to that of a giant dragon.

70
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,166
And look at the back of that fire dragon

71
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,500
That's a fire dragon that's only over 3,000 years old

72
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
He is one of the victorious fire dragons

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,133
Just absorb him

74
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,100
Even people who don’t know how to use fire magic at all

75
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Can immediately use level 7 Mars defense magic

76
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,066
Just catch the bed bugs without any effort.

77
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,500
Maybe also happy

78
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,366
I won’t leave you a whole body yet

79
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,633
Oh, why don’t you commit the crime if you still don’t want to be obedient?

80
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,866
Who is dying

81
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,100
Then you can't blame me

82
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,100
Ha ha ha ha

83
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,633
Lord Barkiak

84
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,866
What a big bald head

85
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:47,133
Kids, no one is allowed to disturb me from now on.

86
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,066
Let me absorb this fire dragon

87
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,833
Only nine precepts remain for success

88
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,633
I’ll treat you to a whole fish feast

89
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,433
Let you eat enough at one time

90
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,100
Ahhh

91
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,600
Ah, what should I do?

92
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
What should I do

93
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,366
Forget it if you can’t get the fire dragon

94
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
I, Lord Yakling, am here

95
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,700
Even the task estimator couldn't complete it

96
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,666
Captain, why don't we withdraw first?

97
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,733
See if there are any other campsites in Jacques

98
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:14,166
Can we complete the task?

99
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,400
we stay

100
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:17,100
I suddenly thought of an idea

101
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,500
Maybe you can get the fire dragon

102
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,033
Can escape successfully again

103
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,400
Maybe we can also take care of Lord Jacques by the way.

104
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,766
But can it succeed?

105
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:29,100
You have to look at Sima Yi

106
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,233
have to say

107
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,633
The leader's plan is very risky

108
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,900
But I like it

109
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,400
The tone of being bullied by those little fish brats

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,066
It's finally out

111
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,600
Still have to be careful

112
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:03,666
It's no use. Why don't I just leave and wait until there is any movement?

113
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,266
Oops haha

114
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,900
Ha ha ha ha

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,333
The little fish boys

116
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,733
Listen to me

117
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,200
I am Lord Jacques

118
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
The most shining bald head in the world

119
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,866
Now I want to announce to you

120
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,000
From today

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,166
Our fish pond

122
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,733
We were punished by the Yaks

123
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,900
I want to do it to you

124
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,100
Spicy and boiled

125
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,966
Red, raw and cut

126
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
I want to make a big fish dinner

127
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,300
Reward all our tribesmen

128
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,900
I will also skin you

129
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,033
Beat your bones

130
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:55,600
And your size

131
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,366
No matter how big it is, you still have to break it off and squeeze out the teeth.

132
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,900
Come on, let’s go quickly. Hey, hey.

133
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,766
Yaklin always fails

134
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,366
I'm going to blow you to the dynamite

135
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,900
Then come here

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,566
fall in love

137
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,633
meet as planned

138
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
Now it's time for Mai to appear.

139
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,466
Ah fish

140
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,366
What a big fish

141
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,566
Why do you want to eat fish?

142
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,200
this shit this year

143
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,233
Ah, it’s so cool to buy

144
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,500
Let's go together and turn the world upside down

145
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,566
According to the leader's plan

146
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,866
There should be some movement outside at this time.

147
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,466
Why are you still so quiet?

148
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:56,900
what a wonderful moment

149
00:11:57,066 --> 00:12:00,166
Is this the prelude to entering the Nine Realms?

150
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,466
Help, isn't it good for you to hit someone?

151
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,300
Our camp was cut off

152
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,233
who is it

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,000
Who deleted my camp?

154
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,600
ah

155
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,966
listen

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,433
I'm waiting for the power of the giant kiln king to declare war on you

157
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,066
A camp for the Yaks

158
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,200
From today on, it belongs to our giant kiln.

159
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,500
King of giant kilns

160
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:31,200
You old guy wants to take my territory and kill me.

161
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,233
angel blessing

162
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:09,866
Haha, brother, I’ll leave it to you next.

163
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:11,666
Oops

164
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:13,966
The show begins

165
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,200
Even your light is also here

166
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:46,433
It's the camp you want to drag me to.

167
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,300
Lord Jayak can hold back such a fireball

168
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,700
Wrong, it should be more than that simple

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,566
Dragon Lady Sword Master

170
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,233
Big fire dragon rock

171
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,600
This is the price you have to pay

172
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,600
But let me abandon you

173
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,266
Pain, despair

174
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,100
You went out of your way

175
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,566
Quite delicious

176
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,966
How about you come again?

177
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:59,800
If you don't come, let me help you.

178
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,400
Wait you wait first

179
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,100
Where is my camp?

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
ah

181
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:28,566
ah

182
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,066
You stinky fish

183
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
I am going to kill you

184
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,466
Even if I die

185
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,033
I want to pull you too

186
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,066
ah

187
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,033
Ahhh

188
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,166
ah

189
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,300
did not expect

190
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,433
Even the level 9 fire dragon was blown into a skeleton

191
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,266
Aha

192
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,400
My fire dragon

193
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,366
If it weren't for the leader's clever plan,

194
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,300
Not only can we fail to complete the task

195
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm afraid I'll end up here again

196
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,100
Isn’t there even any slag left from the King of Giant Kiln?

197
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,266
The self-destruction of Lord Jacques is so terrible.

198
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:09,166
Hey hey hey, I just want to eat fungi like this

199
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,700
Good baby

200
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,633
What a baby

201
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,600
Oh wow, there are also magic guns for both of them.

202
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:26,433
Unexpectedly, I gained a lot this time

203
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,366
alright

204
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,266
Our job with Mr. Jacques is accomplished.

205
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,133
Next

206
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,300
Let's first look for any traces of other demon hunting groups.

207
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:39,400
The captain is about to pass through the province of Jacques.

208
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,666
Didn’t I say that there are many Limengtun villages in Jacques Province?

209
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,400
Why haven't I seen anyone for so long?

210
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,966
What's wrong with us

211
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,800
Balasya

212
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,366
Here comes another group of people who want to die.

213
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:01,100
Prey delivered to your door, hahaha

214
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,433
Favorite and follow

215
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:10,966
Chase the sail without getting lost

216
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,000
You guys are looking at it so carefully

217
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,200
You must have understood the QR code scanning process by heart.

218
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,166
Kill one by one in action

219
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,066
been separated

220
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,466
They are dragons

221
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,266
slayer

222
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,733
you

223
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:38,466
There is nowhere to escape

224
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,633
Even a six-person dare to take the lead

225
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:47,866
Stop talking nonsense and support the Demon Hunting Group?

226
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:50,500
Do you want to make the same mistake again?

227
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,433
Move first1112

228
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,633
You go and help

229
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,766
Then let's solve it together

230
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,366
Invincible

231
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,800
Will again
