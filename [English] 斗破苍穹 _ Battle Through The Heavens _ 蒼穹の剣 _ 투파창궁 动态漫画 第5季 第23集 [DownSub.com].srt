1
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:06,000
If everything is annihilated in an instant

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,300
There is a kind of catastrophe called fate between yin and yang

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,566
I am still cultivating amidst all the disturbances

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,933
The ever-changing fighting spirit of the reef has rushed into the clouds

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,100
Standing on tiptoe, I penetrate the horizon

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,166
I have already turned my tears into smoke

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,600
The flame burning in my heart is still tender

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,066
The world can't hold everything I have

9
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:38,666
No longer walking with head down

10
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,500
I raise my hands

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,966
Turn the green sky into a dazzling rainbow

12
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:49,600
Freedom in Dreams

13
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,300
I fight through the sky

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,900
This crack in the universe is an extremely tiny universe

15
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:01,333
My destiny is mine alone

16
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,766
Woo oh love

17
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:23,500
Friends in front, please help me.

18
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:25,866
ah

19
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:27,700
Pursuit method

20
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,766
There are so many black magic thunders

21
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,200
I made a ninth-grade pill

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,766
The pharmacist only summoned one.

23
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Crazy little brother

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,866
Senior captures the monster

25
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,166
Farewell

26
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,333
It's not that I don't help

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,600
Sorry, my ability is really limited.

28
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,766
I hate it so much

29
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:58,900
Young man, you run so fast.

30
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,400
Seniors please

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,266
It was a close call that I almost ran out of energy.

32
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,566
You are just a five-star Dou Zun.

33
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,100
Dare to come to the Void Thunder Pool for training

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,533
If I hadn't met my senior

35
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,066
I will never experience such danger.

36
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,200
The senior must have escaped from danger.

37
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,533
Sorry, I can't accompany you

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,266
Goodbye haha

39
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,866
Young people still have a little temper

40
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:35,100
In fact, it's much safer if we form a team together

41
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,800
I don't need it.

42
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,500
Why did I come back again?

43
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,466
Farewell

44
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,133
Senior, I was wrong.

45
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,266
Give me a ride

46
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,866
Haha brat

47
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,266
Burning food?

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Hahaha I like it

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,133
It should be safe here.

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,266
Young man

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,366
You also have the Emperor's Ancient Wing

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,333
Dragon King Bone Armor

53
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,466
Which ethnic group are they from?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,100
Are you the legendary dragon and phoenix hybrid?

55
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,500
Purebred human

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,200
Thank you for not admitting it.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,333
I understand, I understand

58
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,333
Hey Hey Young Man

59
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:26,400
You see, we are so related.

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,533
How about cooperating and breaking through the red zone?

61
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,933
Don't look at this black magic thunder, it's very scary

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,666
Absorbed, it is a great tonic

63
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,200
Thank you for not bothering me. I am old.

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,533
Hey, don't be like this.

65
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,066
Actually, the old man is very good.

66
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,166
If it wasn't for the fear of causing a riot

67
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,366
So that they won't chase me everywhere.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,966
Why don't you bring them here?

69
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,066
I'm running around

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,366
Adjournment to the Ono brothers

71
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,200
Go first if you have something to do

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,166
See you later

73
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Why

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,600
Give money, bro

75
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,200
I heard thunder outside.

76
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:02,366
Are you okay?

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,333
Ah, it's okay.

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,866
How come you suddenly come here?

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,566
The bamboo forest elder said he has the key for you.

80
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,800
Please leave with me as soon as possible.

81
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,100
Gone

82
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,100
Fortunately, the old man hid quickly

83
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,700
This guy's name is Xiao Yan

84
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,466
This name always sounds familiar to me.

85
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,333
It's really nice

86
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,200
The young man

87
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:35,066
It would be nice if there were students like this in my college.

88
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,133
Master, Master

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,933
Kirin hahahaha

90
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,900
I'm out of the customs.

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
Six-star Dou Zun Hehe

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,266
Hum, thanks to the dragon energy in the ancient dragon's eyes

93
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:54,800
Soul of the Ancient Serpent

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,466
I have almost completely refined it.

95
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,800
Who dares to bully the young master next time?

96
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll blow his head off.

97
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,500
He is indeed the world's first prodigy

98
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Practice makes things more effective

99
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,400
By the way, where is the Master?

100
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,100
Soon after the Master went into seclusion

101
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,200
The Venerable left in a hurry.

102
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,933
Xiao Yan, Mr. Zhang

103
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,700
Your master seems to have something important to do.

104
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,600
Leave this letter before leaving

105
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:21,000
Look at this Jianxin Express Rail

106
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:21,966
Urgent

107
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,166
Walking in such a hurry

108
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,133
Is there something wrong with Shin Yun?

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,333
No, I'm leaving now.

110
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,300
Brother Xiao Yan has done a great favor to the Taixu Ancient Dragon Clan

111
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,000
I believe that Yun-hye is really in trouble.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,166
I'll go with you

113
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,200
I'll definitely be able to help

114
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Thank you very much, Brother Heiqing

115
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,466
Hahaha

116
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,866
It's a good opportunity for people to recall the past.

117
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,100
My power of the ancient dragon

118
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,100
Thunder

119
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,666
You take 300 Dragon King soldiers and follow Brother Xiao to support Xingyun Pavilion

120
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,100
Master, wait for me

121
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,666
Master Daqiang

122
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't be in trouble

123
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm back

124
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,266
Hey, Senior Brother Xiao Yan

125
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,266
What a coincidence

126
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,700
Master's birthday ceremony is about to begin

127
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:11,266
The young master is back

128
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,100
You brought so many friends with you.

129
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,100
Very good

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,000
Today is Pavilion Master Feng's birthday.

131
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,200
Come celebrate

132
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,166
The guests also come to play.

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,000
This is the market.

134
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,500
Is it a person?

135
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,566
Who knows?

136
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,933
I guess I was tripped up by the prosperity of the world.

137
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,966
Let your gaze be fixed on the rolling red dust

138
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,666
In contrast

139
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,733
I'm just having a birthday

140
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,933
What a tiny thing.

141
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,666
How unworthy he is to pay attention to me

142
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:47,200
Just disappeared like before

143
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,200
So many years

144
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:50,733
Get used to it

145
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,666
Does it matter?

146
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:53,933
Is it important?

147
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:57,400
Is this angry?

148
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,500
Um

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Very angry

150
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,666
Master, please don't come back.

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,566
Wow fireworks!

152
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,100
I remember there was a fireworks segment.

153
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,566
Look at your results.

154
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,100
You're such a jerk.

155
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,800
Hahaha, the banquet is about to begin.

156
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,900
Wow, that was a close call.

157
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,933
I almost didn't make it.

158
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Master

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,900
What is the emergency situation?

160
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,966
I kept you outside for so long.

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,966
Finally got a real body

162
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Of course, we should enjoy the world to our heart's content.

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
You wandered around everywhere, right?

164
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,933
But I do have something important to tell you.

165
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,066
Invitation to the ancient tribe's 20-year coming-of-age ceremony

166
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,400
Ancient tribe Xueer Xiaoyanzi

167
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:05,400
Do you know what a coming-of-age ceremony is?

168
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
Uh, I don't know

169
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,966
That silly boy is

170
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,866
Squeak, squeak, I lied to him

171
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,666
Hahaha

172
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,800
It takes 20 years to hold the first session

173
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
The coming-of-age ceremony can only encourage the best young generation

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Only then can you participate

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,933
Deshuzuwen

176
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,933
Only the most powerful forces will be invited to attend.

177
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,966
If I hadn't entered the semi-saint Xin Yun brother this year

178
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm afraid I won't get this invitation yet.

179
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,966
This snake is rare

180
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,865
The Ancient Eight Clans

181
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,366
Nowadays, only the ancient tribe still likes to make such a fuss.

182
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,866
Which eight tribes are the ancient eight tribes?

183
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,300
The Eight Ancient Clans

184
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,466
They are the ancient tribes you are familiar with.

185
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Soul Clan

186
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,266
Soul Palace

187
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,700
There is also the Yan clan

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Ancestral Eldar

189
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,933
Thunder Clan, you have already defeated the Owl Clan and the Yao Clan

190
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:26,500
Who said there are three thousand fireworks in the world?

191
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:33,800
Like a touch of tenderness in your eyes

192
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:40,133
Someone is walking alone across the desert

193
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:46,366
Rushing to this storm to resolve the confusion

194
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:51,466
Thousands of Knights and Swords by Mistake

195
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,766
People's hearts are in chaos and it is difficult to distinguish between friends and enemies

196
00:09:54,766 --> 00:10:01,700
The red fire has not yet burned away the past, the grudges and the right and wrong

197
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:10,733
Frost and snow kissed my brows, I looked up at the world and mountains and rivers

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,333
Make a promise together

199
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,366
Laughing at the cause and effect to the heaven and earth

200
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,666
It's the legend of this world

201
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:24,300
Wasting time in my dreams

202
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:30,766
Like a passing traveler
