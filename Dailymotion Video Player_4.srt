1
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,600
Light shines through the window at night

2
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,000
And look at the inch finger showing the silk dress

3
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,066
I look forward to the wine, but it is desolate

4
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,200
The bell rings and asks about the turbid wine in the world

5
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,600
A pot of broken heart

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,100
In the world

7
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,100
What's wrong with loving mediocrity?

8
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:07,000
When will the cold-eyed peach blossoms bloom?

9
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,533
Play Xiuxian Wonderful

10
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't move God

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
The artistic conception of a monk lies within his magical powers

12
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,900
Experience it well

13
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,500
I Ching

14
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,466
This is the Yijing

15
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,600
Things change

16
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,333
The love is broken and it is heartless

17
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,400
Happy in my heart

18
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,366
Bullying the outside world is a mediocre pleasure

19
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:46,200
But what is my age?

20
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,733
Go to hell

21
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:51,966
My son

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,966
What's wrong

23
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,500
master

24
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,566
My destiny was broken

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,266
Please avenge me, Master.

26
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,766
What's going on?

27
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,066
Details

28
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,200
A thief escaped from the Shizi Mansion

29
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,900
The disciple was worried about the possibility of failure so he chased after him.

30
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,733
Who knew he was actually an accomplice?

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,800
He used the knife as a shield to injure his disciples.

32
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:41,566
If Fu Er hadn't run away desperately,

33
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,366
I'm afraid Master won't be able to see Fu'er anymore.

34
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,333
You can be sure

35
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,733
You just saw this person

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
There is no spiritual power in the body

37
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,166
It seems like the same as ordinary people.

38
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,500
Absolutely correct

39
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,066
Otherwise, why would I think he was a mortal?

40
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,366
Lead the way.

41
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:06,933
No need to test the horse

42
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,466
We're walking

43
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,066
I haven't taken a walk with you for a long time.

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,733
Farewell Master

45
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,900
Master really dotes on me.

46
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,166
From childhood to adulthood

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,333
He got into any trouble

48
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,366
The master will immediately help him out.

49
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,500
I haven't refused once in all these years.

50
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,100
Why

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,966
With the wisdom of the master

52
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,366
How can I not hear

53
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:40,266
There is a lot of untruth in what my junior brother said.

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,866
I don't know who has offended my junior brother this time.

55
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,566
Which sect are you from?

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,366
Easily broke the younger brother's natal Rakshasa

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,900
I see this person

58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,333
It is likely to be an order.

59
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,133
Your master's position in the Four Sects Alliance

60
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,866
Don't say it's the Dan stage

61
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,566
Even in the Nascent Soul stage

62
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,400
The same outcome

63
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,266
withdraw

64
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,300
Dare to mess with me

65
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,966
I will make sure you die without a burial place

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,666
Sugar Man

67
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,600
Sugar man

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
How do you sell this candy man?

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,966
One copper coin

70
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,900
My Buddha is born in the year of the monkey.

71
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:27,800
Naturally I'd choose this one.

72
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,500
Do you like it?

73
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,166
Um

74
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,400
When I first saw you

75
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,533
You are fighting with a group of kids for a candy man

76
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,400
Maybe you have forgotten

77
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:45,700
How could I forget

78
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,766
Father and son are born with a hard life

79
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,933
If it weren't for the master, he would have died by now.

80
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,066
Let's go

81
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,866
Take me to see that person.

82
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Speak

83
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
What's going on?

84
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,100
Blame it on the rain top

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,700
What rain top

86
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,900
The prince accidentally found a treasure

87
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:14,966
Name Yu Ding

88
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
The alliance has regulations

89
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,466
Civilian protection

90
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:18,366
Must be submitted

91
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,666
The prince was bewitched by the traitor

92
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:23,133
I was careless for a moment and secretly hid the

93
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,366
Who knew that he was discovered by Zhou Wutai of Baiyun Sect?

94
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,333
Directly ordered to kill the prince

95
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,366
The Political and Aide-de-camp

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,900
Now even if the prince offers himself

97
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,333
There is no escape from death

98
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,333
Over the years, the monks who have been replaced have retreated one by one.

99
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,400
I have no other choice

100
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,100
I had no choice but to run to Mr. Wang for help.

101
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,266
Save your life

102
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,900
The cause and effect of these 16 years of service have come to an end.

103
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
You go

104
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,300
Great Grace

105
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,700
Xu Tao keeps it in mind

106
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,166
return

107
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,000
We have guests

108
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,100
He is the master

109
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,100
He hurt me.

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Taoist

111
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,800
How about letting me have a drink too?

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Why

113
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:54,966
Good wine

114
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,366
Since you like

115
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:01,866
The remaining half pot is for you.

116
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,000
Hahaha

117
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,133
Your realm is one level higher than mine.

118
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,800
Transformed into a mortal

119
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,500
admire

120
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,000
Taoist friends share the words of disciples

121
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,933
Understanding the Way of Heaven through One Master and One Father

122
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:24,266
It has the same effect as mine

123
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,866
Why envy others?

124
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:28,166
Um

125
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,733
Today I listen to my disciple's words

126
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,266
Only then did I know that in Kyoto

127
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
There is someone who is at the same level as me and is ready to become a god

128
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,300
Why don't you and I compare ourselves?

129
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:49,600
See who enters the ethereal realm of incarnation first

130
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,133
how

131
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,600
With a comparative mind

132
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,366
I'm afraid Wang will never have another incarnation in this life.

133
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,966
My friend, your words are really harmful.

134
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,166
Hahahahahaha

135
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I didn't expect that in Kyoto

136
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,766
It's a pleasure to meet such a fellow Taoist.

137
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,666
Next week Wutai

138
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,066
I don't know what to call you

139
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,966
Undead King Daoyou

140
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,400
Within a hundred years

141
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,400
You can definitely become a god

142
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,300
Zhou congratulates today

143
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,700
Another appointment with Mars

144
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:40,700
If you really hear

145
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,933
A hundred-year curse in my heart

146
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,566
If I cannot incarnate within a hundred years

147
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,133
Unless you realize it again

148
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm afraid I'll never have the chance in this lifetime

149
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,966
It's too early for Zhou Daoyou to speak

150
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,066
In Wang's opinion

151
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,300
Within a hundred years

152
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Whether Zhou Daoyou can enter the state of transformation is still a good question.

153
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,733
But your disciple will surely die within a hundred years.

154
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,133
Mr. Wang's words are sharp

155
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,333
If I make Zhou Wutai angry

156
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,866
But what can I do?

157
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,300
Could it be that he saw that Fu Er and I

158
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,500
The Key Points of One Teacher, One Father

159
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,266
This person's complex state

160
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,733
Through the understanding of the relationship between master and disciple

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,133
Motivation

162
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,666
Raising children with love

163
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,500
To show favor

164
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,800
Love with Heart

165
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,800
One cup of water

166
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Every move

167
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,333
All to make him himself

168
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,266
Immerse yourself in this career

169
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,400
And he finally realized the meaning

170
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,366
There will be his incarnation

171
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,733
It was the time to kill his own disciple.

172
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,366
Killing the disciple whom he had placed all his heart and soul in

173
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,166
Makes him feel infinitely sad

174
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,533
The last step of being in a state of ecstasy

175
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,766
This god's artistic conception seems to be sentimental

176
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,066
In fact, ruthless

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,133
But this ruthlessness contains the utmost love and nature

178
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,133
First, make a hundred-year promise

179
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:26,700
Then it brought out the true ruthlessness in my heart

180
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,200
Sad obsession with the future

181
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,933
At the same time, in Foer's heart

182
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,100
Leaving a trace

183
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,566
He saw through me

184
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:42,333
I still don't know what he meant.

185
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:44,566
clever

186
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:46,100
clever

187
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,166
Tell your Highness

188
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,500
Send Yu Ding to the Taoist temple within three days

189
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:55,966
I will not pursue this matter any further.

190
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:00,766
master

191
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:13,666
Your disciple will die within a hundred years.

192
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,866
Fu 2 Don't think too much

193
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,266
Why doesn't Tang Ren eat?

194
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,100
The disciple sent by the master intends to keep him forever

195
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,400
This person is my strongest enemy in my life.

196
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,133
This Mr. Wang is so powerful

197
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,366
The monk of Baiyun Sect

198
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,733
Obviously forced the other immortals to retreat

199
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,400
The prince was forced to hide in the palace and dare not go out

200
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,666
He made the immortal give up the pursuit with just a few words.

201
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,600
Desperate situation

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,366
A place of comfort

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,866
Still the Realm of Time

204
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,200
My mood

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,533
What will it be?

206
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,900
ah

207
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,066
Ahhh

208
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,600
ah

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,600
Shopkeeper Wang

210
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:46,733
Chief Wang

211
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,133
daughter

212
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Zeng, a man from Wei Wang, met the Wang brothers

213
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Hey bro

214
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,700
How much is this

216
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,366
Hey, brother, if you don't mind

217
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,866
Come and have a meal

218
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,133
Ahhh

219
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,900
ah

220
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,266
You are not a religious person

221
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,200
Can only enter reincarnation

222
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:50,000
This flower can help you gaze into the soul

223
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,366
Then you can have a good body

224
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,100
grandfather

225
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,300
Where is this

226
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,166
In this abandoned cultivation heart

227
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
I actually had such a profound understanding.

228
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,166
However, with your mere Yuanying cultivation

229
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,933
Don't be too greedy

230
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:08,200
This kind of heaven has not lasted for millions of years.

231
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,400
Unable to find the origin

232
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,366
By then your body will have decayed.

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,366
Destined to die

234
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,500
Old Man Tianyunzi

235
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,400
Let’s make a good relationship today

236
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,966
If you can get out of this abandoned planet

237
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,266
Can you come to heaven to sit on my sacrifice

238
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,000
tomorrow

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Follow the century

240
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400
Go back

241
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,600
If it weren't for Senior Tianyunzi destroying my divine consciousness

242
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:58,333
I may get lost in the mysterious cycle of reincarnation

243
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,266
In the Way of Heaven

244
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,366
A hundred deaths finally solved

245
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,266
These years

246
00:17:57,266 --> 00:18:00,800
It is nothing more than an imitation of the cycle of heaven and earth.

247
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,966
Not a real reincarnation

248
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,866
I still need to pursue my own opinion

249
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,466
Transformation

250
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:18,700
I am the undead

251
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,266
Determined to win

252
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,700
The days on earth always pass quickly

253
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,766
The blacksmith shop of the Daniu couple

254
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,866
It annexed three surrounding shops.

255
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,300
Business is booming

256
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,000
The bull also violated the ancestral teachings

257
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,933
Passed the blacksmithing skills to more gold

258
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,066
I don't want to iron.

259
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,866
I want to learn wood carving from Grandpa Wang

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,733
I don't even understand how to swing a hammer

261
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
Still want to do your grandpa Wang's delicate work

262
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,600
You ignorant little bastard.

263
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,900
Ah, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

264
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Wang Shuo

265
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,500
I won't bring you wine today.

266
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,700
I can't drink it every day when I'm old.

267
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,166
Go Slow

268
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,466
Obviously you are here

269
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,200
Children come here

270
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,066
Root bone Qijia

271
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,533
Best place for spiritual practice

272
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,133
How about letting me accept him as my disciple?

273
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,700
Of course

274
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,566
Of course

275
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:05,966
It doesn't matter if Xiao Niu doesn't practice well.

276
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,566
Come back steadily

277
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,666
Wow it's snowing

278
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:28,600
Over

279
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Why did it snow so early this year?

280
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,666
Summer is coming soon

281
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,500
Okay, stop playing.

282
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,666
This blood

283
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,266
There is murderous intent

284
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,566
Even if there is thunder, I will also hit the snowman

285
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,566
There is a mechanism to conceal

286
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,400
I rely on
