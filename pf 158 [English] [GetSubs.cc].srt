2
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,839
I never bend my knees in my life

3
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,759
Oh, look, look

4
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,639
Hear the pressure on the ancient altar on the fourth floor

5
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,119
Like carrying a mountain on one's back

6
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,199
He can still move forward quickly

7
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,039
I don't know how he did it.

8
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,559
It seems that climbing to the top of this ancient altar is an experience in itself.

9
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,759
To seal the bomb, only for the divine liquid

10
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,199
Since ancient times

11
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,599
Those who ascend to the ninth level of the altar

12
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
Everyone can rule the world

13
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,119
You can leave your name on the magnificent monument

14
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,639
Be famous forever

15
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,839
Leave your name quickly

16
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,799
Now you can know who this person is.

17
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,759
Ah, how audacious

18
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,559
He actually left such a word

19
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,719
How bold

20
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,198
What does this mean?

21
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,719
In what manner

22
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,158
That's outrageous

23
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,519
Remember

24
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,039
This word is not humiliation, but glory, achievement, and brilliance.

25
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,798
Sooner or later the truth will be revealed to the world

26
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,918
That's right, that's great. That's right.

27
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,839
He can still move forward

28
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,199
I will take the Supreme Liquid

29
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,719
The soul transforms into a holy fetus again

30
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,839
This supreme liquid contains the avenue of gods

31
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,199
When the divine fire is lit

32
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,719
It will definitely help me understand more

33
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,879
Where did the sin and blood show up?

34
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,159
So strong

35
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,599
If you were put into the immortal ancient ruins

36
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,639
I'm afraid that it will be given to the disciples of various ancient religions.

37
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,879
Bring big trouble

38
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,159
Three God-level magic weapons

39
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,879
If the disciple can't defeat him, will God take action?

40
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,839
They are all treasures that can completely obliterate the true soul.

41
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,239
It seems that they are planning to kill me here.

42
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,079
It's a pity that this is the spiritual world

43
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,479
Anyone comes to you

44
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,358
We can only use the realm of venerable people

45
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,039
And in the realm of the venerable

46
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,278
i am invincible

47
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,599
I came but still want to leave

48
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,279
Bloody crime

49
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,399
You killed the disciples of the great sect indiscriminately

50
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,198
Fight against divine punishment

51
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,519
break the rules

52
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,119
Will be suppressed today

53
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,799
I passed the spiritual test

54
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,319
You are waiting but trying to do harm

55
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,359
It’s fair to say that I broke the rules

56
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:36,759
This thing is the most precious treasure of ancient religions

57
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,759
You can break through the shackles of the Venerable Realm here

58
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,319
You should die

59
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,279
Break through the shackles

60
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,479
When I was a teenager, I was able to break through the shackles of my realm.

61
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,639
You dare to hurt me

62
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,638
There is no place for you in Sin State anymore

63
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,358
Humph, you never intended to give me a place to stay.

64
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,879
three
shellfish

65
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,039
you you

66
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,959
your biggest mistake

67
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,439
You shouldn't mess with me

68
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,199
Ahhh this

69
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,598
great uncle

70
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,199
gods

71
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,518
He killed the god

72
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,119
The leader of the Kuai Kuai Kou

73
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,638
God died

74
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,679
Assessment ends

75
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,639
Ten thousand venerables can leave the spiritual world

76
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,918
Carrying the body into an uninhabited country

77
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,039
This is where the leader comes in

78
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,759
Bin Hui accidentally died in the no man's land

79
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,119
Three Coins Meifu Two, Qianzhou

80
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,439
Fifty million Venerable Realm monks passing through customs

81
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,839
Country by state

82
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,399
Welcome to the blooming fairy flowers

83
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,399
Entering Immortal Ancient

84
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,399
Very strong wave carrier

85
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,119
A group of common people who have never seen the world

86
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,319
Immortal flower buds are about to appear

87
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,559
Nature will bring auspiciousness and good fortune

88
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,839
otherwise

89
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,439
Let our group of venerables

90
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,799
Going into no man's land to die in vain?

91
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,079
Just this light and rain coming

92
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,839
It can extend people’s life span by a hundred years

93
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,199
Xiandaohua lives up to its name

94
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,919
Three thousand petals, three thousand states

95
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,639
"1/ Major apricot religions

96
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,399
Major ancient religions

97
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,199
Can observe with mana

98
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,839
The situation of Sizi in the Immortal Ancient Relics

99
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,919
Able to observe the condition of part C from the outside

100
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,519
That being the case

101
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,079
It seems there is no need to hide my identity any longer.

102
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,919
You are pretty good

103
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,399
Why don't you follow me?

104
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,439
Tianyao Ge, Qian

105
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,159
It's better than entering Immortal Ancient and giving away your "life"

106
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,359
celestial demon

107
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,239
If you are in the realm of Venerables, you dare to name yourself Heaven

108
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,239
It seems that you are quite capable

109
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,479
That's natural

110
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,919
It is your glory to follow me

111
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,199
It's a pity that I'm alone

112
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,679
Does not include groups

113
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,039
Don't know how to praise

114
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,919
larvae

115
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,799
Ying Yinglong

116
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,679
Yinglong

117
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,479
It must have been attracted by these immortal flower buds

118
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,519
Lu Ya

119
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,759
Ambergris crystals

120
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,239
Good fortune from heaven

121
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,279
These ambergris crystals belong to my heavenly demon Ge Qian.

122
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,279
Who contends with

123
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,919
Not ambergris

124
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,399
It's a dragon

125
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,239
What a heavenly demon who has seen the world.

126
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,199
The competition for geniuses in the Three Thousand States finally begins

127
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,919
See who is respected in this life

128
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,479
No wonder it is called fairy flower.

129
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,639
Each petal represents a kind of avenue

130
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,479
Mapping the past and present

131
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,119
Those sages could not suppress it

132
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,639
Instigated to ignite the divine fire

133
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,919
It should be a place of opportunity

134
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,759
But it became a burial place

135
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,719
Those giant petals are occupied by major ancient religions

136
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,959
Although it is difficult for us casual cultivators to compete

137
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,919
But there is always a path for you and me on the Three Thousand Avenues

138
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,279
These small flaps are the gateway for you and me to enter the ancient world.
